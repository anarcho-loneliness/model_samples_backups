# model_samples_backups
hi, this is a collection of midi sysex backups (the data which forms the Projects and Patterns) as well as a backup of samples (the actual audio files) from my elektron model:samples.

the model:samples i have was used by someone else before me. some of these samples are from them, and not me, but i did end up using them.

also, i think the first sysex dump is either from that previous user, or just the actual stock pattern that comes with the unit. i do not know.

all of this is free to use, sample, remix, edit, distribute, do whatever you want. make music.

also i think the model:samples glitches out in interesting ways if you have one or more of the following:

- samples that are not of the correct format (i.e. sample rate)
- samples that are too long in duration
- samples that have filenames which are too long

so, play around with those things and see if you can make your model:samples behave in strange and interesting ways.
