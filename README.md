# model_samples_backups
hi, this is a collection of midi sysex backups (the data which forms the Projects and Patterns) as well as a backup of samples (the actual audio files) from my elektron model:samples.

the model:samples i have was used by someone else before me. some of these samples are from them, and not me, but i did end up using them.

also, i think the first sysex dump is either from that previous user, or just the actual stock pattern that comes with the unit. i do not know.

all of this is free to use, sample, remix, edit, distribute, do whatever you want. make music.
